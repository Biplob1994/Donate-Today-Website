          More than 109,600,000 people are suffering from poverty and hunger in
          Bangladesh leading to many deaths every day. Hunger is a major concern
          in Bangladesh and since there are many tropical seasons, there are
          deadly storms destroying thousands of crops and farms. With your help,

            In early 2012 I took a trip to South-East Asia in search of purpose
            and meaning in my life. Like most people who set out on a journey of
            self-discovery, I wasn’t sure what I would find. Chance led me to
            meeting Bunrith hermouth.

            When families have nowhere else to turn, they can find sanctuary and

            their kids safe, refugees seeking sanctuary from war and violence,
            and families.

          A family that has been there for our community and given so much needs
          your support. Jake Bulla was involved in a severe motorcycle accident
          recently and as a result, was flown to Royal Perth Hospital and was
          admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Jake is expected to be moved to
          the Spinal Ward at Fiona Stanley Hospital once a bed becomes
          available.

          By giving people the tools they need to capture and share their story
          far and wide, we have built a community of more than 50 million donors
          and helped organizers raise over $5 billion—and we are just getting
          started. The extent of Jake's injuries is unknown at this time, but we
          know there will be a long road to recovery and the very real
          possibility that he may never walk again.
